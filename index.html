            <p>My name is Nick Moore, I moved to Denver in 2008 to finish my BS degree at Rocky Mountain College
              of Art and Design. I first came out to Denver when I was 12 years old and knew that I needed to live
              here one day. And now I do! Yay! I live here with my wife, Kate and our fur baby, Beaux. I am currently
              a graphic designer, and looking to make a change in career to web developement and this course is the
              first step in that goal.<br/><br/>
              When I'm not working I like to watch movies, play video games (console), drink beer, and do typical
              Colorado stuff (hiking, snowboarding, camping). I am very excited to be in this class and very excited
              to get to know and work with everyone! Lets learn the things! ALL THE THINGS!!!!<br/><br/>
              And some Doctor Who-ipsum: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War.
              My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost.
              They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string!
              And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso!
              You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'.
