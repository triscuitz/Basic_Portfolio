            <p>My name is Nick Moore, I moved to Denver in 2008 to finish my BS degree at Rocky Mountain College
              of Art and Design. I first came out to Denver when I was 12 years old and knew that I needed to live
              here one day. And now I do! Yay! I live here with my wife, Kate and our fur baby, Beaux. I am currently
              a graphic designer, and looking to make a change in career to web developement and this course is the
              first step in that goal.<br/><br/>
              When I'm not working I like to watch movies, play video games (console), drink beer, and do typical
              Colorado stuff (hiking, snowboarding, camping). I am very excited to be in this class and very excited
              to get to know and work with everyone! Lets learn the things! ALL THE THINGS!!!!</p>
