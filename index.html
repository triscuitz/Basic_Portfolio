<p>
    My name is Nick Moore, I moved to Denver in 2008 to finish my BS degree at Rocky Mountain College
    of Art and Design. I first came out to Denver when I was 12 years old and knew that I needed to live
    here one day. And now I do! Yay! I live here with my wife, Kate and our fur baby, Beaux. I am currently
    a graphic designer, and looking to make a change in career to web developement and this course is the
    first step in that goal.
    <br/><br/>
    When I'm not working I like to watch movies, play video games (console), drink beer, and do typical
    Colorado stuff (hiking, snowboarding, camping). I am very excited to be in this class and very excited
    to get to know and work with everyone! Lets learn the things! ALL THE THINGS!!!!
